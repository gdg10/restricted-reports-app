    "recon": "Per municipal tax records and google aerial view pictures of the subject property confirm the home is modular construction and the home may have additions, with the total of the newer additions not reflected in online tax records. The tax records indicate the home is 1,404 square feet which may be understated. The additions may only be attached garages. No conversation with the borrower occurred to confirm the additions. The condition and quality of the modular home is a primary factor in estimating the properties overall value. The subject site is mostly flat and cleared with wooded tree lines around the rear and side perimeter. Similar vacant land sales in the immediate area generally between $75,000-130,000. The four most similar comparable transfers are included in this report. The subjectâ€™s value estimate is believed to be within the range of the comparable transfers presented which have all recently transferred in the prior 12 months and all are located within the competing market area. No adjustments have been made to the comparable sales, per the scope of work from the client. This is a desktop assignment. No inspection of the property has occurred. An onsite inspection is suggested to assist in and apply appropriate adjustments to produce a credible appraisal report. The value in this report is a rounded average of the four comparable properties presented and is not a USPAP compliant estimated value. The value is a consulting service performed for the client in a restricted appraisal, desk top report format.",
